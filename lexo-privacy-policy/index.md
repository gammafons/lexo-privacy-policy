The App does not employ third-party companies or individuals. There are no third-party analytics, advertisements, or crash reporting tools integrated into the App.

## Security

Although no personal data is collected or transmitted, I value your trust in using the App. All game-related data is kept only on your device.

## Children’s Privacy

Lexo does not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. Since no personal data is collected from any user, no such data is collected from children.
